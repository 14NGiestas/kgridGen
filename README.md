# kgridGen
Generator for k-point grids.

This code takes a general, integer multiple (3x3 matrix) of the reciprocal lattice vectors and
generates a corresponding integration grid. The code can also generate the symmetrically distinct
kpoints of the full list, with their corresponding weights. Arbitrary shifts of the k-grid
generating vectors are also allowed.
