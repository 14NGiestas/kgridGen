0.1.0 Added functionality for an arbitrary shift. Seems to be working (tried several cases by
hand). Next thing we need is a large collection of unit tests.

0.0.3 Somehow, and old, incomplete copy got pushed and v. 0.0.2, if it was complete, got lost. This
version seems to be working again, with the same functionality.

0.0.2 Added files from laptop. First working copy.

0.0.1 Initial import of rough, working copy of the folding code. Relies on routines in symlib
(getPointGroup, SNF, HNF, etc.)
